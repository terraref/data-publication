# Datasets

In this README, we define the following types of data:


1. Sensor Data: remote thermal, light, and shape sensors scanning a 4000 m2 field at approximately 1 mm2 resolution at hourly to weekly intervals. Additional details in the Sensors section and attached metadata. 
2. Phenotypes: Phenotypes include both sensor-derived and standard field measurements required to validate and calibrate algorithms that compute plant phenotypes from remote sensing data.
3. Environmental data: Time series of meteorological variables including temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, wind direction and speed, photosynthetically active radiation, and downwelling spectral radiance.
4. Genomics: including at least four-hundred novel sequences and outputs from GWAS and related analyses. Contains raw and derived sorghum genome sequencing data. Raw data includes DNA sequence files in compressed FASTQ format. Derived data is available for whole-genome resequencing and genotyping-by-sequencing.
