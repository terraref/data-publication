## General information

* Title: TERRA REF, An Open Reference Data Set From High Resolution Genomics, Phenomics, and Imaging Sensors
* Dates of Data Collection: 2017 and 2018
* Geographic Location: Maricopa, Arizona
  * Center of the field: -111.9749 latitude and 33.07549 longitude
  * Field is 200 m by 20 m
* Keywords: Sensor, Phenomics, Sorghum, TERRA-REF
* Funding: The work presented herein was funded in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), U.S. Department of Energy, under Award Number DE-AR0000598. Computational support was provided by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and XSEDE.

The data pipeline used to process sensor data and generate was described in the @burnette2018 ACM PEARC 2018 proceedings paper "TERRA-REF data processing infrastructure". 

## Data Use, Sharing, and Access


To cite this data: ... 

In addition to the datasets provided in this repository and on Globus, there are instructions for using these data in the documentation.

The TERRA REF documentation is hosted at docs.terraref.org. The section ["How to Access Data"](https://docs.terraref.org/user-manual/how-to-access-data) provides an overview of methods that can be used to access data beyond what is provided in this repository. There is also a pdf copy of the documentation in the file `docs.terraref.org_[date]_.pdf` in the `documentation/` directory.

There are tutorials for getting started with terraref data available at `terraref.org/tutorials` and on github at github.com/terraref/tutorials.

The TERRA REF YouTube channel hosts 1) video walkthroughts of the tutorials https://www.youtube.com/channel/UComeQAqYR5aZrXN_3K5iFGw and 2) a playlist of videos related to the project https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNgRX4VLed8213stlJp60MvVx2p6VTv6N.
