## Data Use, Sharing, and Access

In addition to the datasets provided in this repository and on Globus, there are instructions for using these data in the documentation.

The TERRA REF documentation is hosted at docs.terraref.org. The section "How to Access Data" (https://docs.terraref.org/user-manual/how-to-access-data) provides an overview of methods that can be used to access data beyond what is provided in this repository. There is also a pdf copy of the documentation in the file `docs.terraref.org_[date]_.pdf` in the `documentation/` directory.

There are tutorials for getting started with terraref data available at `terraref.org/tutorials` and on github at github.com/terraref/tutorials.

The TERRA REF YouTube channel hosts 1) video walkthroughts of the tutorials https://www.youtube.com/channel/UComeQAqYR5aZrXN_3K5iFGw and 2) a playlist of videos related to the project https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNgRX4VLed8213stlJp60MvVx2p6VTv6N.
