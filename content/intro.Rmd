# Introduction {#intro}

## General information

* Title: TERRA REF, An Open Reference Data Set From High Resolution Genomics, Phenomics, and Imaging Sensors
* Dates of Data Collection: 2017 and 2018
* Geographic Location: Maricopa, Arizona
  * Center of the field: -111.9749 latitude and 33.07549 longitude
  * Field is approximately 0.4 ha (200 m x 20 m). The scannable area of the field is 22.1 m on East - West axis and 205.5 m on N/S axis.
* Keywords: Sensor, Phenomics, Sorghum, TERRA-REF
* Funding: The work presented herein was funded in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), U.S. Department of Energy, under Award Number DE-AR0000598. Computational support was provided by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and XSEDE.

The data pipeline used to process sensor data and generate was described in the @burnette2018 ACM PEARC 2018 proceedings paper "TERRA-REF data processing infrastructure".

## Data Use, Sharing, and Access


To cite this data: ...

In addition to the datasets provided in this repository and on Globus, there are instructions for using these data in the documentation.

The TERRA REF documentation is hosted at [docs.terraref.org](https://docs.terraref.org). The section ["How to Access Data"](https://docs.terraref.org/user-manual/how-to-access-data) provides an overview of methods that can be used to access data beyond what is provided in this repository. There is also a PDF copy of the documentation in the file `docs.terraref.org_[date]_.pdf` in the `documentation/` directory.

Tutorials for getting started with TERRA REF data are available at [terraref.org/tutorials](https://terraref.github.io/tutorials) and on GitHub at [github.com/terraref/tutorials](https://github.com/terraref/tutorials).

The TERRA REF YouTube channel hosts 1) video walkthroughs of the tutorials https://www.youtube.com/channel/UComeQAqYR5aZrXN_3K5iFGw and 2) a playlist of videos related to the project https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNgRX4VLed8213stlJp60MvVx2p6VTv6N.

All original software are licensed with the BSD 3-clause or MIT/BSD compatible license. All software used for data processing have been archived on Zenodo and are available on GitHub in the `terraref` organization: [github.com/terraref](https://github.com/terraref).

This software was created specifically for the field scanner data processing pipeline that is described by @burnette2018. The file `code/source_code_dois.txt` provides the DOIs for code archives that contain the state of the software at the time the data were processed. Further development has been moved to [github.com/AgPipeline](https://github.com/AgPipeline).
