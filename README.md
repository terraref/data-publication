# Dryad Data Publication for TERRA REF Data Publication

* Title: "TERRA REF: Open access reference data and computing infrastructure for high throughput plant phenotyping"	
* Scope: This is a data descriptor, intended to be a citable reference that briefly describes and points to data products from Seasons 4 and 6.
* Lead / Coordinating Author: David LeBauer (dlebauer@arizona.edu)

This form is for authors of the initial data publication to be submitted to Dryad and associated paper to be submitted to Nature Scientific Data. The author list is expected to be long, and inclusive of all who have made meaningful contributions as described in the "contributions warranting authorship" defined in the TERRA REF authorship guidelines: https://terraref.gitbooks.io/terraref-documentation/content/manuscripts-and-authorship.html

## Status 

**July 02 2020**

* A draft of the data and [README for Dryad](https://github.com/terraref/data-publication/blob/master/terraref-dryad.pdf) have been submitted to Dryad for review. 
* A more descriptive data paper will be submitted to Nature Scientific Data. This is being developed in the repository https://github.com/terraref/data-paper. Please contribute there or contact David if you are interested in contributing to this effort.
