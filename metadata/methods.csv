Manual canopy height,"Canopy height estimates for each single row of 2-row plots.  Measured in cm using meter stick, taken at the height representing the plot 'potential', ignoring stunted plants. The canopy height was measured as the height of the foliage (not the inflorescence) at the general top of the canopy where the upper leaves bend and/or establish a canopy surface that would support a very light horizontal object (imagining a light sheet of rigid plastic foam), discounting rare or exceptional leaves in the upper-most 2 or 3 percentile.","Newcomb, Maria",Field measurements from Maricopa Agricultural Center,2016,

Canopy cover estimation from ground-based conventional photographs,"This protocol describes a method for estimating canopy cover from photos obtained using conventional digital camera mounted on a custom-designed A-frame support. The images are processed with ImageJ to obtain an estimate of canopy cover.  The protocol steps and ImageJ settings and macro are described in the protocols.io open repository within the TERRA-REF group documents.  See the following link:

Visual classification of sorghum growth stages to determine estimates of developmental timing,"Sorghum growth stage descriptions follow Vanderlip RL. 1993. How a sorghum plant develops. Manhattan, KS, USA: Kansas State University Cooperative Extension. 
Growth stages grouped by the following categories:  vegetative growth prior to flag leaf emergence; flag leaf emergence; heading; flowering (anthesis); milk stage; soft dough stage; and hard dough stage.  The first date of each growth stage recorded by plot based on observations made in the field at intervals that varied from 3 to 7 days, more frequently during the early season with warmer temperatures and less frequently later season when temperatures decreased.  The time between sowing and the first date of each growth stage was calculated to determine the following plant variables: 
flag_leaf_emergence_time; 
heading_time; 
flowering_time; 
grain_milk_stage_time; 
grain_soft_dough_stage_time; 
grain_hard_dough_stage time

Leaf surface temperature and stomatal conductance estimates using hand-held instruments,"Repeat measurements were taken using hand-held instruments to estimate leaf surface temperatures and leaf stomatal conductance within 6-8 select plots (3-4 accessions x 2 replicates) on 7 dates in mid to late June 2017 (sorghum season 4) as part of a focused field phenotyping campaign related to stomatal regulation.  Leaf surface temperatures were estimated using a FLIR TG167 Spot Thermal Camera (http://www.flir.com/instruments/tg167/) and an Apogee Infrared Radiometer Model MI-230 (https://www.apogeeinstruments.com/ultra-narrow-field-of-view-infrared-radiometer-with-handheld-meter-mi-230/).  Measurements were taken on sunlit leaves, targeting fully expanded when possible, at a distance of approximately 20 to 40 cm above the leaf surface.  Within each plot and at each measurement time, 6 total measurements were taken using the FLIR and Apogee instruments, with 3 measurements taken in each of the West and East subplot rows.  Leaf stomatal conductance was measured using a Decagon SC-1 Porometer (https://www.decagon.com/en/canopy/canopy-measurements/sc-1-leaf-porometer-stomatal-conductance-measurements/).  Within each plot and at each measurement time, 5 total measurements were taken using the porometer, on sunlit leaves targeting fully expanded leaves when possible.  On each of the 7 dates when measurements were taken, early morning baseline equilibrium readings starting at 5:45 to 6:00 for one cycle through all 8 plots.  Mid-day readings started at roughly 11:00 and continued through 3 repeat cycles of the 6-8 plots until roughly 15:00 to 16:00.  The porometer was calibrated at least once in the early morning and again before the mid-day readings.  The FLIR TG167 spot camera was tested against a thermal blackbody unit on 2017-06-21 (recorded 5 readings at 34.5 to 34.6 C while the thermal blackbody recorded 33.9 C).  During the later measurement dates, 2 plots were dropped from the repeat measurement cycles because they had grown out of reach for hand measurements.

MultispeQ v1.0 field measurements of fluorescence-based and absorbance-based parameters,"Measurements of multiple photynthesis-related parameters were taken on sunlit leaves in the upper canopy using the handheld MultispeQ v1.0 instrument and the Leaf Photosynthesis protocol macro code developed by PhotosynQ Admin.  (https://photosynq.org/protocols/leaf-photosynthesis-multispeq-v1-0) 
Measurements made during August 2017 in the BAP experiment required a ladder to access leaves in the upper canopy.  Repeat measurements were taken on select plots between approximately 10:30 and 14:30, typically cycling through 8 plots (4 accessions x 2 reps) several times to establish a time series of the parameters centered around solar noon.  At each sampling time for each plot, 6 subsample measurements were taken within the plot.  During August 2017 irrigation treatments were implemented at two levels (water-deficit zones with no irrigation and well-watered zones irrigated for optimal plant water status).  Plots were selected for measurements within each of the two irrigation treatments. ","Newcomb, Maria",Maricopa Agricultural Center Field Measurements and Activities,2017,

Leaf polyphenolics and chlorophyll measurements: Dualex Scientific+ leaf-clip handheld optical meter,"The optical leaf-clip meter (Dualex Scientific+) uses 5 LED light sources, including 1 UV-A, 1 read and 2 near-infrared (NIR) and a silicon photodiode detector to estimate chlorophyll content in leaves as well as flavonol and anthocyanin contents in the leaf epidermis.  Measurements were taken on sunlit leaves in the upper canopy.  Within each sampled plot, multiple subsample measurements were taken, each on different leaves, targeting fully developed sunlit leaves when possible. The instrument reports 5 measurements:  1) the temperature of the optical emitting head, 2) chlorophyll index (=(NIR trans. - Red trans.)/Red trans), 3) flavonol index (=Log(NIR fluo. excited red/NIR fluo. excited UV-A), 4) anthocyanin index (=Log(NIR fluo. excited red/NIR fluo. excited green), and 5) NBI (proprietary) nitrogen status, Chl/Flav ratio.
